	<h1>1. Most Successful Indian Captain</h1>
	India had players like Sunil Gavaskar and Sachin Tendulkar, who broke all the records in terms of batting, but they couldn’t add the same sugar in their captaincy. The one man who won most Test Matches for India as a captain was Mahendra Singh Dhoni. He captained India in 60 Test Matches and won 27, most by any Indian captain. He lost 18 Test Matches, which were second highest after Nawab Pataudi’s 19 losses. During his captaincy, India won 21 out of 27 Test Matches at home soil, most by an Indian Captain.

<h1>2. Most Runs as an Indian Captain</h1>

	<h1>3. Highest Number of Matches as an Indian Wicket-Keeper</h1>

	<h1>4. Highest Individual Score by an Indian Captain</h1>

The knock comprised 6 sixes and 24 fours and spanned 265 balls.
